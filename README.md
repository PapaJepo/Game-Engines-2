# Game Engines 2
For my Game Engines project I want to recreate this scene from Halo Reach.

The First scene would be the take off scene from the station which would then transition into the space ship entering space. It would then transition into the space battle and finish of with the ship docking at the port.

I'm looking forward to working on this assignment as Halo Reach is one of my favourite games.

The main ship model was made by me.
