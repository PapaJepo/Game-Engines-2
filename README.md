# Game Engines 2
For my Game Engines project I wanted to recreate this scene from Halo Reach.

The first scene is of the Sabre ship taking off which then transitions into the space battle scene where the ships will attack the enemy ship until it leaves then the main ship will dock at the station.

The project runs when it's played, no controls needed.

Using movement behaviours shown in class I used these to control the ships in space and by using my own waypoint script which uses seek steering I made the take off scene.

For this assignment what made me proudest was recreating a scene from a game I love and I feel I recreated it well.

The base steering script, event manager, takeoff manager, Space Manager bullet and ship shooting.#

All other scripts used the behaviours covered in class.

The First scene would be the take off scene from the station which would then transition into the space ship entering space. It would then transition into the space battle and finish of with the ship docking at the port.

The main ship model was made by me.
